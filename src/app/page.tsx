      <h1>Hi, I&apos;m Atsushi Hatakeyama</h1>

      <p>
        Welcome to my personal corner of the internet. I&apos;m a software engineer
        passionate about building things that make a difference.
      </p>

      <h2>What I do</h2>

      <p>
        I spend my time writing code, exploring new technologies, and working on
        projects that interest me. I believe in building software that is both
        functional and elegant.
      </p>

      <h2>My approach</h2>

      <p>
        I value simplicity and clarity in everything I create. Good software
        should be easy to understand, maintain, and extend. I strive to write
        code that future developers (including future me) will appreciate.
      </p>

      <h2>Beyond code</h2>

      <p>
        When I&apos;m not coding, you can find me exploring new ideas, reading, or
        working on side projects. I believe in continuous learning and pushing
        the boundaries of what&apos;s possible.
