Welcome to my blog! This is my first post written in Markdown.

## Why Markdown?

Markdown is a simple and powerful way to write content:

- **Easy to write** - Simple syntax that anyone can learn
- **Portable** - Plain text files that work anywhere
- **Version controlled** - Works great with Git

## How it works

Just create a `.md` file in the `content/blog` folder with frontmatter at the top:

```yaml
---
title: Your Post Title
date: 2024-12-28
excerpt: A short description of your post.
---
```

Then write your content in Markdown below the frontmatter.

Happy writing!
