## Beyond the Nihilism

When I was younger, I spent a great deal of time thinking about the meaning of life and why we learn and live. Life is full of difficulties and problems, and after long reflection, I came to one conclusion: there is no inherent meaning to life.

Once I accepted that, I began to follow my passions and intuition. If life has no predefined meaning, then I am free to live in a way that feels right to me. I chose to live according to my ethics, dreams, and what inspires me. Over time, I arrived at a rational truth—at least for myself.

There may be no inherent meaning in life, which is precisely why we must create our own. For me, that meaning is to inspire others, make people happier, and help create a better place to live. That is why I started a company, continued studying, and actively engage with others.

You do not need to find a grand or sublime meaning. As long as you are satisfied with the life you are living, that is enough. Having moved beyond nihilism, I continue to live fully today.
